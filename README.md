## üß∞ Development Environment Setup

> üêç **Requires Python 3.12 or higher**  
> üí° **Requires pip 24.0+** for proper dependency resolution.  
> Run this first to ensure you're up to date:
> ```bash
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
> ```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell)
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the FastAPI server
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once running, open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)  
to explore the interactive Swagger API documentation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Developer Notes
* It‚Äôs recommended to **use a separate venv per Python version** (e.g., `venv312`) for clarity.
* `pip` is not listed as a dependency in `requirements.txt`, but **pip ‚â• 24.0** is recommended.
* If any dependency issues occur, ensure both your **Python** and **pip** are up to date.
